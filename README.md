# Mentorness_Intern

During my internship at Mentorness, I had the opportunity to dive deep into a hotel reservation dataset and extract valuable insights using SQL. This project has been an incredible learning experience, and I’m thrilled to share my findings!

🔍 Key Insights:

Most Popular Meal Plans: Discovering which meal plans guests prefer the most 🍽️
Top Room Types: Identifying the most frequently booked room types 🛏️
Booking Trends: Analyzing the distribution of bookings across weekends and weekdays 📅
Lead Time Insights: Examining the highest and lowest lead times for reservations ⏳
Market Segments: Uncovering which market segments drive the highest average room prices 💼
Reservation Patterns: Understanding monthly booking trends throughout the year 📈
Family-Friendly Insights: Analyzing reservations involving children to determine the most common room types and average prices 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦
This comprehensive analysis can help hotels enhance their guest experience, optimize operations, and improve profitability. Check out my presentation to see the full analysis and insights!
